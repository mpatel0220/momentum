## How would I like to improve the world?

Track the progress of people's work more efficiently.

## Why is this a problem?

Today most of them are facing problems in being on track with their work. Running behind the track will affect them mentally by demotivating them and making their progress even worse.

## Potential solutions:-

- Track their progress by breaking down it into smaller tasks like daily tasks and weekly tasks.

- Assisting them by generating a plan to complete their backlogs.

- Making it easier for the users to track their progress by visualizing all the data in an attractive and easily understandable way.

- Allowing the managers/mentors to access the data of members/students, so that they can keep an eye on students and can reach out to them asap when they are stuck somewhere.
